# Kitty Camp Mod

## About
Kitty Camp is a lightweight camping mod that adds a way to make smores, from a stick and cook them next to an open flame! (Both camp fires and both fire types work (Regular, Soul)

 

The Recipes are as follows, all are shapeless (Will add pictures when able)

Sharp stick (for cooking on!) - Flint + Sticks = 3 Sharp Sticks

Marshmallow - Mallow Plant + Sugar = 3 marshmallows

Chocolate - Cocoa Beans + Sugar = 3 chocolate

Grahm Crackers - 2 Sugar + 1 Milk Bucket + 1 Wheat = 6 Grahm Crackers

Smore - 2 Grahm Crackers + 1 Chocolate + 1 Cooked Marshmallow = 1 Smore

 

To get cooked marshmallows, Put a sharp stick down next to a fire, and right click with a marshmallow

to pick up any of the sticks, shift and right click on them!

To take a marshmallow off, just right click with an empty hand!

To re-use a stick, right click it with an axe!

Hope you enjoy my mod <3
